My name is Melinda. I am a rising senior in <a href="Baruch.htm">Baruch College Campus High School</a>.
I am currently 16 years old.
I really enjoy listening to K-pop and watching K-dramas because I really love Korean culture.
I also want to be able to travel many parts of the world because I had never been on a plane before.
I am interested in traveling in areas such as South Korea, Japan, New Zealand, and many other places.
Through this site I will be telling you more about myself!
</p>

<p onmouseover="this.style.color='red'" onmouseout="this.style.color='blue'">
As a rising senior, I am well aware of the college process ahead of myself. I can already
feel the pressure and stress of having to mentally preparing for the application such as
the SATs, the college essays, the recommendation letters and other things. I have not fully
decided what I want to persue in college but I have some sense to what I want to do.
Also, being a student from Baruch College Campus High School (BCCHS) is different from other schools
because the school is generally small in comparison to other schools. There is many
limitations to classes students can take because it is a small school so there would not be
a lot of teachers. However, I try to take as many classes as I can to take hold of the opportunities.

I do not remember exactly how I got into K-Pop and K-dramas. However, I highly reccomend
exploring the K-pop music viedos on YouTube because although they may seem strange
or weird they start to become addicting. Regardless, you will find music and get into
fandoms that you would not think you would ever be part of. K-dramas are different
because there are different generes such as romance, comedy, mystery and others.
I think they are entertaining because of the storyline/plot that you would never see
in American shows. Also, Korean variety shows are entirly on another level than American shows
because people on the show that many risks to make the most enjoyment for their audience.

  Through my love for K-pop and K-dramas, I learnt a lot about the culture of South Korea
  as well as their delicious food. My favorite food is defientely Korean because it is amazing!
  Korean food is well known to be spicy or just mild. For instance, there are many flavors of
  ramen noodles and in one case there is the Fire Noodles Challenge which
  is a "super" spicy ramen. There are different flavors now considering there is cheese flavor,
  chicken flavor, spicy X2 flavor and many more.

I would consider myself a foodie because I love food and eating food. I really enjoy exploring many
types of foods in the city with my friends. We (my friends and I) even decided to make
a food squad group because we enjoyed trying out new foods/desserts. An easy way to plan
places to go is through the app Yelp. It helps to find food around your location as well as helping you to 
find certain types of food that you desire. The app is convient and helpful! Also, it allows you to see the reviews and comments 
of other customers. You are able to see what you would expect if you were going to the store.
Another way is through Insider. Insider have made many videos of their experience of certain stores 
and emphasized the beauty of their food. It opens your options to other stores you did not know of before
as well as different areas you have never explored.

<h1 id= GWC align=center> Girls Who Code (Adobe NYC) </h1>

<p onmouseover="this.style.color='red'" onmouseout="this.style.color='blue'">
Through Girls Who Code (GWCs), I learnt a lot of the fundamentals of coding and met new people from different
backgrounds and skills. It started simply with simple Scratch and later throughout the weeks we expanded our
knowledge to HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, and may more. It was really challenging having to go in with little 
experience and trying to jump into coding. I had always thought coding was a very boring aspect but there are actually 
many branches of computer science. My outlook of computer science has shifted throughout the 
weeks as I realize how complex coding is to how many things could be achieved through coding. I was also able to listen 
to people's stories and their journey in the field they are in. Many of the guest speakers made me develop a new 
profound respect to those who know how to code because they are helping technology evole from where it is at 
now. Their stories and advice was empowering and enlightening. I defientely want to reconsider taking courses in 
computer science in college as well as creating a coding club for my last year in high school.

<p onmouseover="this.style.color='red'" onmouseout="this.style.color='blue'"> 
We learnt more about adding CS and Javascript to our HTML website. We were creating our own websites about ourselves.</p>
<h3 style = "font-size: 20px" align=center>Week 4: Robotics </h3>
<p onmouseover="this.style.color='red'" onmouseout="this.style.color='blue'"> 
During this week, we played around with the arduino. We worked in groups of four where we learnt about lighting up 
LEDS as well as making the robot to move around. We were able to make a cherography for the LEDS and robot to follow for the Cupid Shuffle. It was difficult to make the LEDS blink or follow the speed of the music with the code because sometimes the LEDS were 
a few seconds too fast or too slow. Through this week, I realized there was a different field of computer science which is 
mechanical engineering which works with machinery.
