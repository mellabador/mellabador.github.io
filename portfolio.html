<h4> About Me </h4>
<body>
My name is Melinda. I am a rising senior in Baruch College Campus High School.
My birthday is on November 22nd which makes me a Saggitarius.
I really enjoy listening to K-pop and watching K-dramas because I really love Korean culture.
I also want to be able to travel many parts of the world because I had never been on a plane before.
I am interested in traveling in areas such as South Korea, Japan, New Zealand, and many other places.
Through this site I will be showing things that make me who I am.
