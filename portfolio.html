<h4> About Me </h4>
<body>
My name is Melinda. I am a rising senior in Baruch College Campus High School.
I am currently 16 years old.
I really enjoy listening to K-pop and watching K-dramas because I really love Korean culture.
I also want to be able to travel many parts of the world because I had never been on a plane before.
I am interested in traveling in areas such as South Korea, Japan, New Zealand, and many other places.
Through this site I will be telling you more about myself!

As a rising senior, I am well aware of the college process ahead of myself. I can already
feel the pressure and stress of having to mentally preparing for the application such as
the SATs, the college essays, the recommendation letters and other things. I have not fully
decided what I want to persue in college but I have some sense to what I want to do.
Also, being a student from Baruch College Campus High School (BCCHS) is different from other schools
because the school is generally small in comparison to other schools. There is many
limitations to classes students can take because it is a small school so there would not be
a lot of teachers. However, I try to take as many classes as I can to take hold of the opportunities.

<h4> K-pop and K-drama </h4>
<body>
I do not remember exactly how I got into K-Pop and K-dramas. However, I highly reccomend
exploring the K-pop music viedos on YouTube because although they may seem strange
or weird they start to become addicting. Regardless, you will find music and get into
fandoms that you would not think you would ever be part of. K-dramas are different
because there are different generes such as romance, comedy, mystery and others.
I think they are entertaining because of the storyline/plot that you would never see
in American shows. Also, Korean variety shows are entirly on another level than American shows
because people on the show that many risks to make the most enjoyment for their audience.

Through my love for K-pop and K-dramas, I learnt a lot about the culture of South Korea
as well as their delicious food. My favorite food is defientely Korean because it is amazing!
Korean food is well known to be spicy. For instance, there is the Fire Noodles Challenge.
